## position
The position property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The offset (**top**, **right**, **bottom** and **left**) properties determine the final location of positioned elements. CSS supports 5 different positioning methods
 - Static(default)
 - Relative
 - Absolute
 - Fixed
 - Sticky

**Static**
: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. the offset properties have no effect. This is the default value.

**Relative**
: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of a document, and the offset relative to itself based on the value of top, right, bottom and left. the offset does not affect the position of any other elements
