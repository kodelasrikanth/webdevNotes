## position
The position property sets how an element is positioned in a document. The offset (**top**, **right**, **bottom** and **left**) properties determine the final location of positioned elements. CSS supports 5 different positioning methods
 - Static(default)
 - Relative
 - Absolute
 - Fixed
 - Sticky

**Static**
: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of the document. the offset properties have no effect. This is the default value.

**Relative**
: The element is positioned according to the normal flow of a document, and the offset relative to itself based on the value of top, right, bottom and left. the offset does not affect the position of any other elements thus the space given for the element in the page layout is the same as of position were static.
